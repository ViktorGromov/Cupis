IMPORTANT INFORMATION  ABOUT  STYLING THIS THEME
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Charis Church theme CSS was generated using a SASS V3+ (SCSS - Sassy CSS syntax) 
CSS preprocessor.  SCSS is a superset of CSS3 syntax. A CSS3 stylesheet is valid SCSS as well. 
SCSS files use the extension .scss. The source files are in the library/scss folder 
(styles are mainly in _base.scss). Using SASS/SCSS variables will help with tasks 
like defining a new color scheme. 

If you prefer using regular CSS (CSS files are in the css folder), then go ahead and modify the CSS files. In either 
case, we suggest you use a child theme (please see the child theme instructions in the readme.txt file). 

If you decide to use SASS/SCSS at a later date, please be aware that a SASS preprocessor 
will generate new .css files, so be sure to back up any .css files you changed before running the preprocessor.
